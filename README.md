## ðŸ“ˆ Example Use Case

A bar manager selects their location and a specific alcohol brand in the dashboard. They instantly see:

- Estimated waste if demand is lower than expected
- A visual trend of weekly demand with the forecasted par level

## âœ… Future Improvements

- Add support for seasonality/event-based spikes
- Use advanced models (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) for long-term forecasting
